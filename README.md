# Notes
When constructing the Unet, need the number of resnert blocks to be divisible by the output dimension. When copying the code from the [lucidrains repo](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch/blob/main/denoising_diffusion_pytorch/denoising_diffusion_pytorch.py), I had to change the default number of resnet_blocks from 8 to 4 so that the size of fashion mnist images (28x28) was divisible by the number of groups on line 280.
